              Programming teaches valuable problem-solving skills, making it a
              skill everyone should learn. As the Coding Club of a technical
              institution, we organize coding events, workshops, contests, and
              mentorship sessions to build a vibrant coding community. We
              believe code, like poetry, should be elegant and concise. Our
              mission is to nurture a strong coding culture and create a
              collaborative environment for learning and growth. Recent
              initiatives include dedicated groups for competitive programming,
              development, and machine learning, along with a mentorship program
              to support newcomers. We are committed to carrying this momentum
              forward.
