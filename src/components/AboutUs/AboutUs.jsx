          <p>
            Programming teaches valuable problem-solving skills, making it a
            skill everyone should learn. As the Coding Club of a technical
            institution, we organize coding events, workshops, contests, and
            mentorship sessions to build a vibrant coding community. We believe
            code, like poetry, should be elegant and concise. Our mission is to
            nurture a strong coding culture and create a collaborative
            environment for learning and growth. Recent initiatives include
            dedicated groups for competitive programming, development, and
            machine learning, along with a mentorship program to support
            newcomers. Weâ€™re committed to carrying this momentum forward.
